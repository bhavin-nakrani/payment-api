# WARNING: Disabling foreign key checks globally will turn off InnoDB FK enforcement
# across the entire server. This is dangerous for data integrity and NOT recommended
# for production systems. Prefer using session-level `SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=0;`
# when performing controlled maintenance operations.

# Disable foreign key checks (applies globally while server runs)
